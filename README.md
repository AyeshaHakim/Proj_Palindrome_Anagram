# AYESHA HAKIM - LIC Coding Test Solution Submitted on 14-12-2016

The program contains two class files: Program.cs and PalindromeClass.cs

Program.cs contains class 'MainClass' and PalindromeClass contains class 'PalindromeClass'.

Main Class is the entry point that invites user to enter a valid string, gives instructions, 
instantiate PalindromeClass and calls its three function taking string as parameter and return a boolean.

is_invalidString: checks whether the entered string is valid based on the given assumptions.

is_palindrome: checks whether the enetered string is a palindrome.

is_anagram: checks whether the enetered string is an anagram of a palindrome.

The function also checks is the string is neither a palindrome, not an anagram and display the message.

All three functions are protected by try catch block to avoid any exception.

The functions are called under a loop continuously asking for input from user unless the key 'n' is pressed.
The repo has the "Terminal Saved Output" in a text document that contains the test cases for the following scenerios:

We must enter a string.

Captial String is invalid.

*** is invalid.

123 is invalid.

anna is a Palindrome.

abc is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome.

aaaaaaaa is a Palindrome.

aaaaaaaab an Anagram of a Palindrome.

caaaaaaaab is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome.

donotbobtonod is a Palindrome.

owefhijpfwai is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome.

igdedgide is an Anagram of a Palindrome.
