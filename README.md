# AYESHA_HAKIM_LIC_Coding
The code contains two classes: MainClass and palindrome
Main Class is the entry point that invites user to enter a valid string, gives instructions, 
instantiate palindrome class and calls three function:

is_invalidString: checks whether the entered string is valid based on the given assumptions
is_palindrome: checks whether the enetered string is a palindrome
is_anagram: checks whether the eneteres string is an anagram of a palindrome

The function also checks is the string is neither a palindrome, not an anagram and display the message
The functions are called under a loop continuously asking for input from user unless the key 'n' is pressed.
The repo has the "Terminal Saves Output" in a text document that contains the test cases for the following scenerios:

We must enter a string
Captial String is invalid
*** is invalid
123 is invalid
anna is a Palindrome 
abc is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome 
aaaaaaaa is a Palindrome 
aaaaaaaab an Anagram of a Palindrome
caaaaaaaab is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome 
donotbobtonod is a Palindrome 
owefhijpfwai is neither a Palindrome nor an Anagram of a Palindrome 
igdedgide is an Anagram of a Palindrome
